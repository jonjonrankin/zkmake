I want a neovim autocommand or maybe writing a plugin that integrates with zk and mimics obsidian's wikilink placeholder behavior. in other words, if in a md file inside a zk notebook, and you type [[new note]] but "new note.md" doesn't exist yet, you can *make* new note.md by putting your cursor inside the double brackets and running a command (a command that can be mapped to, e.g., <leader>zm)
